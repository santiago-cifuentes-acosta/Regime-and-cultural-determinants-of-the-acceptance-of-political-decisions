Analysis of the dataset Regime and Cultural Determinants of the Acceptance of Political Decisions in Times of Crisis (DAPEK) (Giebler et al 2022), downloaded from GESIS Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences. I explore the responses of over 9000 research subjects in 6 countries to questionnaires about their political views and attitudes toward policies implemented in the COVID pandemic.

The authors wish to understand what conditions make it more likely that people will give up individual liberties for the common good, and their questions explore topics such as prohibitions to go to public places or travel internationally without a good reason, closing of schools and delay of elections. Each row is marked by the option of policy they chose (A/B) and the answers to their questions. To analyse this dataset, I used Power BI, creating bar charts, pie charts, and using DAX for notes. 

I find that the most significant difference between voters of A and voters of B is their country of origin. Other factors such as education level, employment status or gender proved to have little impact, although age group had some naticeable weight.
